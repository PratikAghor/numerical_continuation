* This folder contains my recent attempts of learning numerical continuation. 
* Debugging help: Tanumoy Dhar (UCSD)

* Some good references to start learning about numerical continuation:
1. 'Practical Bifurcation and Stability Analysis' - by RÃ¼diger Seydel
2. Numerical analysis and control of bifurcation problems (I): bifurcation in finite dimensions - by Doedel et. al.
